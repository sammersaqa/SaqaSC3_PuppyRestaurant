Great to work with, carried a lot of the beginning stages by putting in extra work after class so we could get a head start. Kept everything organized and cosistently was checking in with everyone to avoid any conflicts while working. Worked mainly on photos and catering pages.
Helped everyone with the layouts for their pages, as well as doing the mobile responsiveness.
