My personal review: I think I did pretty good I did everything I was assigned. I mainly focused on trying to improve my styling in CSS and getting more used to the different layout styles and how to use them for specific circumstances. Overall the assignment wasn't that difficult but it still provided a challenge trying to format it in such a specific way while also keeping it responsive.
