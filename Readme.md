## Puppy Restaurant 

## Brief Description of what you did : This project is a mockup website for "Muzzle's Sandwiches & Grill" designed with a focus on responsive layout using Bootstrap and custom CSS for aesthetics. 

<!-- ## Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment : Lucas Guptill, Website looks great with coloring background and most all navigation, one big change id reccomend is turning your image in the top left into a button that goes to your home page(index) as the mockup site does not include a home button and your image is already acting as a button but it simply isnt bound to anything. The image on the main index page needs to be sligtly larger in height as to match the mockup site as well. the about and menu pages looks pretty good however for your menu page the line dividing menu options needs to be colored the dark red as to match the mockup site, 2 of your menu cards are also missing a menu option as only one card has 4 choices but your on the grill and sandwiches section is missing the 5th menu option, i highly reccomend going into your css files and removing the font weight: options as they only bolden text when the mockup site has very light and not bold text for a majority of the sections (it should just make it look more like the mockup site when removed), the mobile and tablet versions look really nice and work, only issues i could find is on the photos page at 1024 for laptop sizing it breaks the images BUT that doesnt really matter because tablet and mobile work just fine so in terms of what were graded on id say mobile and tablet are perfect!  --> ### This has been corrected to the best of our ability.
